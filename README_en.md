# IlyaCommonAPI

[中文](https://github.com/IlyaYezelovsky/IlyaCommonAPI/blob/main/README.md) | **English**

A Java package that is not very useful and is written just for fun. This may be the simplest and most brutal GitHub repository, because you don't even need to build, just use the code directly.

## Contents:
* Class `Vector`: flat vectors
* Class `Complex`: complex numbers
* Class `ARandom`: a more convenient random generator
